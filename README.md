# EcoTrack - AI-Powered Emission Violation Detection System

An intelligent environmental monitoring system that uses computer vision and machine learning to detect vehicular emission violations in real-time, contributing to urban air quality improvement and environmental compliance.

## üåç Project Overview

EcoTrack combines AI-powered computer vision, environmental data analysis, and smart city integration to create a comprehensive solution for tackling urban air pollution caused by vehicle emissions. The system processes live traffic footage to identify emission violations and automatically notifies relevant authorities and vehicle owners.
